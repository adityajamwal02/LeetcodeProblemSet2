/*
Given an array A[ ] your task is to complete the function max_val which finds the maximum value of abs(i – j) * min(arr[i], arr[j]) where i and j vary from 0 to n-1.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 4
arr[] = 3 2 1 4
Output: 9
Explanation:
Here, a[0] = 3 and a[3] = 4
and thus result is
abs(0-3)*min(3,4) = 9.

Example 2:
Input:
N= 4
arr[] = 8 1 9 4
Output: 16
Explanation:
Here, a[0]=8 and a[2]=9 thus
result is abs(0-2)*min(8,9)=16.
Your task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function max_val() which takes the array and it's size as input and returns the maximum value of abs(i – j) * min(arr[i], arr[j]).

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
*/

/*The function returns an integer
which denotes the max value
of abs(i â€“ j) * min(arr[i], arr[j])
in the array.
*/

/*You are required to complete this method*/

        while(low<high){
            ans=abs(low-high)*min(arr[low],arr[high]);
            result=max(result,ans);
            if(arr[low]<arr[high]){
